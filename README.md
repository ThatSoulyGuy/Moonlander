# Moonlander

A renamed project (Invasion2)

* ## What this is
    * This is a video game about landing on the moon, hence the name, Moonlander.
* ## Gameplay
    * You first land on the moon, and walk around a bit. You will notice that you have an oxygen dial that indicates how much oxygen you have remaining. If you run out of oxygen, you will slowly die. In order to beat the game, you must, through a somewhat complicated series of steps, build a rocketship manned by none other than YOU! Using this rocket, you can fly back to earth.
* ## Technical Details Nobody Cares about
    * This game was made in Java 23 using the Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL), in combination with the Java OpenGL Mathematics Library (JOML).
    * Dependencies
        * Classgraph (traversing files within a JAR file)
        * Jetbrains Annotations (@NotNull, @Nullable, etc)
* ## Modding
    * Thanks to Java, this game is fully moddable. The way mods work is that you link against the Moonlander jarfile, and then use the modding API. This whole game is designed around code reusability and modularity, meaning that this game was intended for modding from the very beginning. In order to learn how to make mods, you can look at the Wiki page on setup and creation.
